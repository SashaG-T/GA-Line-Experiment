# GA-Line-Experiment
An experiment for visualizing artificial selection using OpenCV.

Written in C++. It was written in Visual Studio Community 2017 but it only consits of one file so I figured I'd upload the single file and let others decided how they want to compile and run it.

# Compiling
You'll need to link against OpenCV using some C++ compiler.
